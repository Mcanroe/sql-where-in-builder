# SQL WHERE IN Builder

An extremely simple web application using JS that formats a list of values for a SQL `WHERE IN` clause.

## Usage

1. Paste your list of values into the input area
2. Click "Convert" to format for SQL
3. Use "Add quotes" toggle as needed
4. Click "Copy to Clipboard" and paste into the SQL IDE of your choice

## Why

There are sites online that do the same but I do not trust their privacy policies.

This can also be done via Excel functions or if you use Datagrip then it has a feature to do this directly.

Ultimately, this is something I've built for personal use cases that also served as a good starting point to learn a little bit of JS.

## Privacy

**All processing happens locally in your browser.** No data is transmitted to servers or stored anywhere. Your input values never leave your device.
